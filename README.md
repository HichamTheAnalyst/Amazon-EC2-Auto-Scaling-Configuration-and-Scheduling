# Amazon-EC2-Auto-Scaling-Configuration-and-Scheduling


This project demonstrates how to create and configure an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with scheduled scaling policies to automatically scale resources up and down based on predefined times, optimizing cost efficiency.

## Key Features:
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Automatically manages EC2 instances based on specified scaling policies.
- **Scheduled Scaling**: Scales down EC2 instances to zero every day at 01:00 AM to minimize costs.
- **Cost Optimization**: Ensures resources are only active when needed, reducing unnecessary expenses during off-peak hours.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Amazon EC2 instance management
- Auto Scaling group configuration
- Scheduled scaling policies for resource optimization
- CloudWatch monitoring and cost efficiency strategies

## Setup Instructions:
1. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group and assign EC2 instances.
2. Configure a scheduled scaling policy to scale down to 0 at 01:00 AM every day.

## Technologies Used:
- Amazon EC2
- AWS Auto Scaling
- AWS CloudWatch
